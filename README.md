# 👋 Hello there, I'm Łukasz

I'm a graduate of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Silesian University of Technology, which I completed in February 2024. Currently, I'm continuing my education at the same university, embarking on a Master's degree.

My passion for learning doesn't end in the lecture hall. In my free time, I enjoy expanding my knowledge of familiar technologies, as well as discovering new ones. I'm particularly interested in the .NET platform and the C# language, and I'm actively working to deepen my expertise in these areas.

I believe that continuous learning is the key to success in the rapidly changing world of technology. 🤗
